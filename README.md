This app helps users connect with venues and book gigs. It allows for two separate workflows: 

One, where an artist can:
    - sign up 
    - create a profile
    - link their spotify data
    - view and apply for gigs
    - rate their experience with the venue

The second, venue owners can: 
    - sign up
    - create venues they own
    - post gigs at their venues
    - review artists that apply
    - contact artists that they are interested in hiring
